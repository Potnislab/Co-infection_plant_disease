Abstract

Mixed infections caused by multiple pathogenic and weakly pathogenic strains inhabiting the same host plants are common in nature and may modify pathogen dynamics. However, traditional plant pathogen studies have mostly focused on the binary interaction between a single host and a single pathogen. In this study, we have looked beyond this binary interaction and evaluated the impact of co-infection on disease dynamics on tomato using the bacterial spot pathogen, Xanthomonas perforans (Xp), co-occurring weakly pathogenic strain of X. arboricola (Xa) and co-occurring potential weak pathogenic strain of Pseudomonas capsici (Pc). Time-series co-infection experiments monitoring disease severity and within-host population dynamics revealed higher disease severity in co-infection by three species compared to infection by Xp alone. However, co-infection by dual species, Xp and Pc or Xa resulted in lower disease severity compared to Xp alone. Thus, co-infection outcomes depend on interacting species. Weak pathogens could exploit Xp to colonize the host plant as indicated by their higher populations in co-infection.  However, Xp population dynamics was dependent on co-infecting partner. While resource competition might be a possible explanation for lower Xp population in dual co-infection, interaction of Pc with the host was found to influence Xp population. Interestingly, Xp population was higher in presence of three-species interaction compared to Xp and Xa co-infection, suggesting potential modulation of co-operative interactions among Xp and Xa in three-species co-infection rather than competitive interactions. Humidity played a significant role in population dynamics of the three species. Overall, this study highlighted importance of co-infection dynamics in studying plant disease outbreaks.
